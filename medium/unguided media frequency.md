# Unguided Media Frequency

Unguided media, which transmit signals without `physical conduits`, utilize various frequencies depending on the type of communication and application.

## 1. Radio Waves

- `Frequency Range`: Typically from `3 kHz to 300 GHz`.
- `Applications`: Used in `AM and FM radio`, television broadcasts, and wireless communications (e.g., `Wi-Fi`, `Bluetooth`).

## 2. Microwave Transmission

- `Frequency Range`: Generally between `1 GHz and 300 GHz`.
- `Applications`: Employed in point-to-point communication links, satellite communications, and some Wi-Fi technologies.

## 3. Infrared Communication

- `Frequency Range`: Approximately `300 GHz to 400 THz` (though not always categorized by frequency in the same way as radio and microwaves).
- `Applications`: Common in remote controls, `short-range` data transfer (like some wireless peripherals), and certain types of wireless networking.

## 4. Millimeter Waves

`Frequency Range`: Generally between `30 GHz and 300 GHz`.
`Applications`: Used in advanced telecommunications, including 5G networks, and certain types of `radar`.
