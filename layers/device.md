# Table of Layer-wise Devices

### 1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)

**Devices:**

- `Hub`: Connects multiple Ethernet devices, making them act as a single network segment. `Hubs transmit data to all connected devices`.
- `Repeater`: Regenerates and amplifies signals to extend the distance of a network.
- `Network Cable`: (e.g., Ethernet, fiber optic) used for physical connections.

## 2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

**Devices:**

- `Switch`: Connects devices on a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the appropriate destination. Unlike hubs, switches intelligently direct data only to the intended recipient.
- `Bridge`: Connects and filters traffic between two or more network segments, reducing collisions and improving performance.
- `Network Interface Card (NIC)`: Allows devices to connect to a network, providing a hardware interface.
