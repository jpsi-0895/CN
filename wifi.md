# Wi-Fi

## Frequency Bands

2.4 GHz and 5 GHz: Wi-Fi operates primarily in these two frequency bands, allowing for different ranges and speeds.

- `2.4 GHz`: Longer range but more prone to interference from devices like `microwaves` and `Bluetooth`.
- `5 GHz`: Shorter range but less interference and higher speeds

## Data Rate

Variable Speeds: Wi-Fi data rates can vary based on the standard, channel width, and environmental factors:

- Wi-Fi 4 (`802.11n`): Up to 600 Mbps.
- Wi-Fi 5 (`802.11ac`): Up to several Gbps.
- Wi-Fi 6 (`802.11ax`): Up to 9.6 Gbps under optimal conditions.

## Security

Encryption Protocols: Wi-Fi employs several security measures, including:

- WEP (`Wired Equivalent Privacy`): An older, less secure standard.
- WPA (`Wi-Fi Protected Access`): Improved security with `TKIP` (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol).
- WPA2: Uses AES (A`dvanced Encryption Standard`) for stronger security.
- WPA3: The latest standard, offering enhanced security features.
