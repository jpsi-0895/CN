# Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)

Here are some numerical questions related to Carrier Sense Multiple Access (`CSMA`), particularly focusing on concepts like delay, throughput, and efficiency.

## 1. Throughput Calculation

## 2. Average Waiting Time

**Question:**
In a CSMA/CD network, the propagation delay between two nodes is 15 ms. If a node sends a packet and then has to wait due to collisions, what is the average waiting time for a subsequent attempt, assuming it uses exponential backoff?
