# IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)

The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) maintains standards for various protocols, including those used in networking. 

While IEEE does not assign protocol numbers like IANA does for IP protocols, it does define various standards and protocols under specific IEEE designations.
