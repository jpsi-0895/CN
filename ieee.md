# IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)

The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) maintains standards for various protocols, including those used in networking.

While IEEE does not assign protocol numbers like IANA does for IP protocols, it does define various standards and protocols under specific IEEE designations.

## IEEE Protocol Standards

### 1. IEEE 802.1

Description: Standards related to network management and bridging.
Notable Protocol: Spanning Tree Protocol (`STP`).

### 2. IEEE 802.3

Description: Standards for Ethernet and its various physical layer specifications.
Protocol: Ethernet (`wired LAN`).

### 3. IEEE 802.11

Description: Standards for wireless LANs (`Wi-Fi`).
Notable Protocols: Wi-Fi standards (e.g., 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax).

### 4. IEEE 802.15

Description: Standards for wireless personal area networks (`WPAN`).
Notable Protocol: `Bluetooth` and `Zigbee`.

### 5. IEEE 802.16

Description: Standards for broadband wireless access, known as `WiMAX`.

### 6. IEEE 802.22

Description: Standards for wireless regional area networks (`WRAN`), which operate in the `TV broadcast` bands.
